Description: This package, Lattice Options and Add-ins (or loa), contains various plots and 
   functions that make use of the lattice/trellis plotting framework. The plots (which include 
   loaPlot, GoogleMap and trianglePlot) use panelPal, a function that extends lattice and hexbin 
   package methods to automate plot subscripting and panel-to-panel and panel-to-key 
   synchronization/management. See ?loa for further details.
