Description: Various plots and functions that make use of the lattice/trellis plotting framework. 
   The plots (which include loaPlot, GoogleMap and trianglePlot) use panelPal, a function that 
   extends lattice and hexbin package methods to automate plot subscripting and panel-to-panel 
   and panel-to-key synchronization/management. See ?loa for further details.
